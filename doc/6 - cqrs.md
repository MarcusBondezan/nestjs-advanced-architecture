# CQRS

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a software architectural pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns between reading data (queries) and writing data (commands) by employing distinct models for each operation. This approach deviates from traditional architectures and CRUD systems where a single model handles both read and write operations. As applications become more complex, the divergence in requirements for reading and writing data can result in issues related to performance, scalability, and maintainability.

## Core Concepts

CQRS divides the application's data model into two main components:

- **Command model**: Responsible for handling write operations, encompassing data modification. This model enforces rules and validation logic to ensure correct and consistent data changes.

- **Query model**: Manages read operations, focusing on data retrieval. The query model is optimized for reading data and often employs denormalized data structures or specialized views tailored to specific read use cases. This separation facilitates efficient querying and enhances overall read operation performance.

## Benefits

CQRS offers several advantages:

- **Performance**: Enables independent optimization of read and write operations. Different data stores can be used for read and write models, allowing for the selection of tools optimized for specific use cases.

- **Scalability**: Facilitates independent scaling of read and write operations. For instance, in a flight booking system, where read operations are more frequent than write operations, scalability can be tailored to each operation's demands.

- **Maintainability**: Permits the evolution of read and write models independently, enhancing the system's maintainability.

## Drawbacks

Despite its advantages, CQRS introduces some challenges:

- **Complexity**: Adds complexity to a system, making it harder to understand. Not well-suited for simpler applications.

- **Eventual Consistency**: The read and write models are typically eventually consistent. Changes made to the write model may not be immediately reflected in the read model. While not inherently a drawback, it requires awareness when implementing CQRS.

## CQRS and Events

CQRS often synergizes with Event Sourcing and Event-Driven architectures to provide a comprehensive solution for managing data and events in complex systems.
