# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development technique that places a strong emphasis on the domain model and domain logic. At its core, DDD aims to establish a language that bridges the gap between the implementation and the understanding of business experts. This involves directly incorporating words and phrases from the domain into the code base, allowing for the creation of a comprehensive model that accurately represents the domain's objects and their interactions.

## Strategic Design

The strategic design phase of DDD focuses on identifying the core domain and subdomains. Additionally, it involves defining bounded contexts and context maps within the system to ensure clarity and coherence.

## Tactical Design

To express the domain model in code, DDD follows a tactical design process that employs specific building blocks:

- **Entities:** Objects with a unique identifier and a life cycle. They are immutable and can undergo modifications over time, maintaining a conceptual identity even if attributes change. Entities are distinct from one another, even if they share similar attributes.

- **Value Objects:** Immutable objects without a unique identifier. Equality is based on having identical attribute values.

- **Aggregates:** Clusters of objects treated as a single unit to ensure consistency. Aggregates represent transactional consistency boundaries, meaning changes within the aggregate should occur in a single transaction.

- **Repositories:** Responsible for persisting and retrieving aggregates, abstracting the data access layers.

- **Services:** Encapsulate domain logic not tied to a specific entity or value object. However, caution is advised as excessive use of services can indicate an anemic domain model, lacking meaningful domain logic.

- **Factories:** Dedicated to creating complex objects, especially useful for scenarios involving complex validation, initialization, or multi-step coordination. Factories contribute to maintaining a clean domain model focused on business logic.

- **Events:** Used for communicating and capturing domain-specific information about actions or changes in the domain model. Events play a crucial role in achieving loose coupling, scalability, and eventual consistency in distributed systems. Two types of events are distinguished: domain events, focusing on changes within the domain model, and integration events, facilitating communication between different parts of a system, particularly in distributed or microservices architectures.

In summary, DDD provides a comprehensive approach to software development by emphasizing a rich domain model, fostering effective communication between stakeholders, and employing tactical design principles to express the domain in code.
